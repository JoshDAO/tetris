### Tetris
This will be a functioning Tetris game. I will use this project to get to grips with some advanced CSS

## To do:

1. Create table. A Tetris table has 10 columns and 20 rows. Decide whether this should be done in a HTML table or CSS grid.
2. Create auxilliary elements. Score, Next piece, PLAY button, Timer. Level etc
3. Apply CSS to create colour scheme
4. Create shapes, using grid for dimensions.
5. Assign shapes to array and create random number generator for creation of shapes.
6. Use time intervals to determine rate at which shapes drop by 1 row.
7. Implement keyboard funtionality to move and rotate shapes.
8. Create some sort of check to determine a full-row of filled shapes 
9. Create graphic that flashes and removes shapes from that row
10. Create checks to ensure hen the shapes reach the tp, the user loses.
11. If timer runs out and user is still alive, they win that level. Advance to next level?
